My cooking approach is always based on working with whole, seasonal ingredients wherever possible. I want to work mostly mornings and weekdays. I'm not adverse to covering stations sometimes, but I'm not willing to go back to the PM service lifestyle full time. If you want someone to come in and hit the ground running, quickly understand the moving pieces of your operation, and bring focus and craft to your food, I'm your person. I'm not trying to be the chef; I've been there, and at this point, I'd rather be the guy in the morning making you look good in the evening.If you're looking for a reliable, cheerful, knowledgeable professional to help in your kitchen, I can offer these skills (and more):Expert sauce work: I make beautifully seasoned, elegantly textured sauces, with an appropriate balance between novelty and familiarity. I love working with fresh herbs and making unctuous stocks. My favorite mother sauce is mayonnaise.Whole animal butchery: I have butchered 12-15 pigs, 4 steers, and countless fish and smaller animals. While I'm not at the level of a professional butcher, I can do a quick, tidy job of it, and have trained other people to butcher as well. My butchery has mostly been in restaurants, so I'm well-versed in producing menu-friendly cuts.Sourdough bread baking: I bake high-hydration sourdough bread with an emphasis on whole grain flavor. I developed a bread program for a farm-to-table restaurant using local stone milled flour. I also have extensive experience with other applications of bread dough, from pizza to breakfast baked goods.Fermenting: if it grows, I've probably fermented it. I'll always be a bit of a hippy cook at heart, and I feel like fermenting vegetables is an essential technique for extending seasonal produce availability and creating more profound flavors.Recipe development/consultation: I have taken on two consulting gigs, transforming or adding to the food programs for restaurants. I have plenty of experience developing and writing recipes that work!You: an NYC restaurant or other food operation with high standards and some ambition, but not on the Michelin grind.

I'm 29, born in '92 if that's relevant.Greetings Caring Comrades:\\tI am seeking an administrative career position (5 years experience) with a passion for creative writing (songs and poems mostly) and a heavy interest in the non-profit sector and children's care services due to my own adversities. In fact, I hope to one day open a children's center situated around the arts (song writing, singing, playing, dance etc.) to be called Chasesop's Center for Song where we spread art through the lessons in music, where you unfablely belong.        I surely bring the required qualifications to the table as I have most recently held a position as a Front Desk Clerk (Temp) at a housing non-profit and currently in student housing, as well as previous posts as a Pet Care Manager/ Receptionist, Salon Coordinator, Bed & Breakfast Front Desk Receptionist, and Volunteer Salon Front Desk Receptionist throughout my later teens. I, also, have endured many physically and mentally demanding obstacles in my previous factory setting. I hope to grow in this field to gain the knowledge to pursue my passion. I'd, also, potentially be interested in a volunteer opportunity. All of which brings me to the conclusion that I am the missing puzzle piece in your dream team.

      "['Editing and Writing Services', \"Thank you for stopping to read this. I have been freelance writing since 1998. I have written everything from letters to the military explaining a criminal record, essays for undergraduate, graduate, medical, and law school; including application questions.Dear John letters, short essays, term papers, grant proposals, statements for court, lesson plans, ethics, bioethics, content writing, final projects, theses, speeches, and short stories. You name the topic, I've probably written it at least once. Despite having written on so many subjects over the years,, I do not plagarize; this includes my own previous work.I went to a local University here on Long Island but did not grow up here. I majored in Sociology (concentrations in poverty and drug abuse) with minors in Psychology and Literature. Because I have been asked previously, my native language is English. I can speak some pqssiblrle French and very limited Spanish. I can write in read/write in Cyrillic and speak rudimentary Russian. Both of my parents were newspaper editors, so growing up I had to look up a word if I didn't know what it meant.In order for me to edit a paper, I need what you have written already, a clear copy of what the professor has assigned/the parameters of the project, and links to all sources cited (or to be cited).If you need me to write something for you, I need the assignment as stated by the professor, sources to be cited(of there are any required). It is also a good idea for me to see a sample of something you have written previously so I can mimic your writing style. If this is not possible, that is fine.Please note that what I am doing is completely legal. I am creating a work with words. Just as when I have sold some of my artwork. If someone chooses to purchase my work and pass it off as their own, that is not my business. As for editing, if there are any question as to the legality of that, I don't even know where to begin.One last note, I am a human, not a machine. Please do not message me and ask me to come up with a 5 page essay in less than 24 hours when it is already two days overdue.Lack of planning on your part in no way constitutes an emergency on my part. Also, if I am not provided with the assignment (as defined by the professor), then I can not write the paper.Rates vary upon what is needed and how in-depth the subject content needs to be. I usually charge $15 per page for editing and $20 per page for writing. Also, if you do not provide source matetial, I charge $8 for every source that I need to find.Additionally, all papers are billed in double space format. If the professor states that the assignment should be done in single spacing then what is written will fit the specifications, but will be billed as written in double space format.I also charge $10 per hour for any reading I need to do to adequately write your paper. That being said I have been a poor (economically) college student spent the bulk of my career working for nonprofits. I'm no mercenary and will work with someone on price should the situation necessitate it.Conversely, if a project necessitates a lot more of my time of time, I may have to charge more than the prices quoted above. Fees really are dependent on the assignment and what it entails.I do give ample time for the client to read over everything, and payment is not made until the client is happy with the finished product. Once the paper is paid for the paper is unlocked and no longer my property. What individuals choose to do with anything I have written is solely up to them.I am well versed in the social sciences, literature, English, Reading Comprehension, art, and conceptual (ie. Biology, Environmental Science, Bioethics etc.) sciences. I am abhorrent when it comes to math, physics, chemistry and anything involving numerical calculations.So, if you have too much work and not enough time, or you're just not sure how exactly to word something, send me an email and we'll see what I can do to help. In all the years I have done this I only had one complaint, and I honestly do not think that the client even reviewed what I wrote, or anything in the class for that matter.Thanks for reading this and good luck with your studies.    \"]\n",

This was at the Dr. Frederick H. LaGarde Sr., Academy. This not only helped to recap my previous knowledge about computer science, but also strengthened some of my core strategies with respect to computer operations and file management. My goal is to be able to continue my computer science career in a job field that allows me to further develop my skills and techniques, and also be a part of a team that actively builds computer related platforms such as software or internet applications. I hope to continue being a part of the field of education in addition to the previously mentioned goals. While working as a computer teacher at Dr. Frederick H. LaGarde Sr., Academy I was responsible for outlining and teaching a fundamental level computer syllabus to a range of grade school students. The age groups of these students were between 8 and 12 years old. The program covered basic computer operations such as computer start up, rebooting, account management, and also covered common software usage, as well as file and folder creation.Most of my personal interests are internet-related. I sincerely see the world wide web as becoming more and more an invaluable tool as the 21st Century rolls on. Apart from my technical knowledge, a lot of what I(and many other techs in America) have to offer an employer is derived from: informative exchanges with friends; daily use of the computer and internet; and a particular interest in following up on and studying new material encountered. I think this makes me a strong and unique candidate with a real world appreciation of how competitive a job market it can be. I am also aware of how lucrative an opportunity any tech or tech-related job can be. Therefore, finding any kind of work in the field of technology is a reason to be grateful. My personal hope is that the work-relationship I end up with on my quest for hire will be well worth the wait.Yours Sincerely,Prince Gonzalez']\n"

That is the primary reason I am so effective at helping business leaders protect themselves from having the business process fall out of sync with technology. I provide the technical resources to solve business issues and fix computer problems by staying up to date. It would free up the time or energy that would otherwise be spent on trying to figure out the newest technology on their own.I believe in doing the right thing by my clients. I subscribe to the philosophy that the technology for business is just like legal or accounting advice and is not a do-it-yourself practice. I provide the benefit of managing your technology needs along with a proven track record from my 20 years of experience.I am ideally looking in a position that has some emphasis on networking and systems administration. I have done many networking contracts in the past and it is really where my heart is. Although I have experience setting up and configuring networks, there's a lot to learn. For example, I would like to start working with enterprise equipment and learning the how-tos to improve on what I already have and at the same time offer what I already know.

I’d love to work alongside someone with more skill in some of these areas and do basic assistant style work while getting trained in more difficult stuff.

Not currently in the area because I’m poor but sitting on multiple finished pilots and riding the compliments of someone with several Emmy wins. Also a film I did rewrites on recently got partially filmed. So maybe I’m less “aspiring” than I think I am. But after more talks with agents than I can count that passed on me regardless of the WGA telling me to “try” and the silence of a major network that took my scripts in for reads. I’m coming back to where I began. Craigslist. Just to see if there’s anyone that might have a use for me. Period drama to comedy. I hit a lot of marks apparently. Seeking a chance to earn because again. Poor. Yes I posted this in NY and LA. Two dream cities but trying a few to see which works out first for a move basically but if you’re trying to get a nutshell kind of view on me. Sort of Bobby Lee meets Audrey Hepburn. The jarring mental image that gave you is the key. I’m a messy dreamer that likes big ass sunglasses but I bring the heat and hopefully hopefullness. The voice acting and acting, something I’ve done for fun but had a director see something in me. Some auditions went well. It isn’t my favorite thing but if it can help pay rent i’m all for trying whatever. As I somehow found a way to get exceptionally clear audio in here. I have a range but english accent seems to be my strong point which is just weird for a southerner.Same with radio. Some dudes I respect at Sirius XM gave me a listen doing airchecks. To my surprise I wasn’t hated. Just posting this on some catch all hope to maybe land something to help relocate sooner than later. Had a legendary radio host tell me to start a podcast but being in the south. Not being overtly interesting. Knowing I’d need to rely on guests I can’t get. It seems like a crap shoot. Thanks for reading.    ']\n",

Few things about me : I graduated with my Bachelors from Penn State University. I have experience in the following; medical health industry, banking, customer service, retail, childcare, and office administration. I hope to find a position that is flexible, in the sense that I am not confined to a desk or schedule because my current schedule is flexible, I need something that i can do in person and from home. I need to be able to manage my time. With that being said I can most definitely meet deadlines, and reply within minutes as well as get things done as soon as possible. I have been looking for a part time/flexible position for a little while now, but i thought it would be best to post what i am looking for rather than applying and turning down several job offers due to the fact that I can't be tied down to a set schedule.
